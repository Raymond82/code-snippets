#introduction

I used to read codinghorror since it is an interesting blog for programmers. On it, he mentioned the fizzbuzz problem and the (lack of) skill of senior programmers.

I decided to do a take on this, "the proper way".

> write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

I decided to make some different versions on it to show my thought-process.

#versions

- v1: basic version, basic implementation with a simple for-loop
- v2: separate logic from for-loop
- v3: place logic inside a domain-class
- v4: unit test this version
