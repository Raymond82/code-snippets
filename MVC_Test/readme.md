I used to work on the "old" mvc framework.

This project is a result of my research into the aspnet.core (little bit of de-rusting). 

For now it features:
- Sqlite database (including generator)
- Display data from the database on a web page using a controller

I plan to:
- See how relationships are handled (I want to be able to navitage from albums to artists)
- Make it look a bit more nice (add some css)
- Check out a (lazy?) list, filtering options, sorting options
- Incorperate this into a home page
