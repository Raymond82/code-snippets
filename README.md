# code-snippets
This repository has some example/test code written by me.

# ConsoleSnippets
Some code where I play around a bit with .NET code, showing of some use of the framework.

# FizzBuzz
Old classic, my implementation of FizzBuzz, see https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/ as well.
I decided to start with the most basic implementation and end with a split solution with unit tests.

# MVC_Test
I used to work on the "old" mvc framework.
This project is a result of my research into the aspnet.core (little bit of de-rusting). I want to create a small project showing of features of aspnet core.
